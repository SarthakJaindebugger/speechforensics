    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required packages using the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    pip install speechbrain
    pip install torchaudio
    pip install numpy
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install Werkzeug
    pip install pydub

## Steps to Start Flask Backend Server

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sarthak_new_flask
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## Steps to Run React Frontend Application

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd sarthak_new_flask/audio-violence-detection-app
    ```

2. Run the application using npm:
